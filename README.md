# Deep Dive Insights

## Sales Trends

Between 2019 and 2022, the business processed over 108K orders and brought in $28.1M in total revenue. The most dramatic growth occurred in 2020, when sales spiked by 163%, fueled by a 101% increase in order volume and a 31% boost in average order value. While AOV dipped 15% in 2021, overall sales held strong — still 136% above pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, however, revenue fell by 46% as order volume dropped 40% and AOV returned to its pre-pandemic average of $230. Even so, order activity remained 28% higher than in 2019, preserving a solid share of earlier gains. Going forward, the focus will be in stablilizing this retention and building toward sustainable growth. 

### Seasonality

Similarly, ThinkPad Laptops, second in AOV, earned 11% of total sales despite having a none too disimilar total order count of 3%. This demonstrates how even even modest volume gains in high-AOV categories, especially laptops could drive significant revenue growth, making them strong candidates for targeted promotion.
